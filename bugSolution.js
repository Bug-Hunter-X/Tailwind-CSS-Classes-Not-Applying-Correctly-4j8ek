// Ensure your Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up. 
// Check your `tailwind.config.js` for correct paths and settings.
// Check your `index.html` file or main layout for the correct inclusion of the generated CSS file.

// Clean and rebuild your CSS:
// npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

// If using a build process (like Vite, Webpack, etc.), ensure that the Tailwind CSS plugin or loader is configured correctly and that your CSS is being properly processed.

// Verify that the CSS generated by Tailwind is correctly included in your project.

// Add the necessary directive to your CSS file:
//@tailwind base;
//@tailwind components;
//@tailwind utilities;

// Correct Tailwind CSS usage:
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
  <p class="text-white">This text should be white.</p>
</div>
